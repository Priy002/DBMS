1) INNER JOIN
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;

2) LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
Example
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

3)RIGHT JOIN
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the
left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.
Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;


4) Full Join
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2)
table records.
Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;
Example
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
